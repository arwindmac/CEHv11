# Information Security Overview

## Elements of Information Security
> Information Security -> "the state of well-being of information and infrastructure in which the possibility of theft, tampering, or disruption and services is kept low or tolerable"

### Five Major Elements:
1. Confidentiality
   - Information is only accessbile only to *authorized*
   - Breaches may occur due to *improper data handling/hacking attempt*
   - Controls include *data classification, data encryption, and proper disposal of equipment*
2. Integrity
   - *Trustworthiness of data or resources* in the prevention of improper and unauthorized changes
   - Information is sufficiently *accurate for its purpose*
   - Controls: include a *checksum* and *access control*
3. Availability
   - Assure systems responsible for delivering, storing, and processing information are accessible when required by authorized users
   - Measures: disk arrays for redundant systems & clustered machines, antivirus software, and DDoS prevention system
4. Authenticity
   - Characteristics of communication, documents, or any data that ensures quality of being genuine or uncorrupted.
   - Major role -> confirm that a user is genuine
   - Controls: biometrics, smart cards, & digital certificates.
5. Non-Repudiation
   - Guarantee that the sender of a message cannot later deny having sent the message || recipient cannot deny having received the message.
   - Individuals and organizations use *digital signatures* -> ensure non-repudiation.

## Motives, Goals, and Objectives of Information Security Attacks
Attackers generally have motives (goals), and objectives behind theri information security attacks. It originates out of notion - target systems stroes or processes something valuable, leads to threat of an attack.

PurposeL disrupt target's business operations, steal valuable information

Motives depend on the attacker's state of mind, their reason for carrying out such an activity, as well as their resources and capabilities.

`Attacks = Motive(Goal) + Method + Vulnerability`

### Motives behind Information Security attacks:
- Disrupt business continuity
- Financial loss to the target
- Propogate religious or political beliefs
- Perform information theft
- Create fear and chaos by disrupting critical infrastructure
- Damage the reputation of the target
- Manipulating data
- Achieve a state's military objectives
- Demand ransom
- Take revenge

## Classifications of Attacks
> Information Warfare -"Use of information and communication technologies for competitive advantages over an opponent"

Ex: viruses, worms, Trojan horses, logic bombs, trap doors, nanomachines, microbes, electronic jamming, penetration exploits and tools.

1. Command and Control Warfare (C2 Warfare)
2. Intelligence-based Warfare
3. Electronic Warfare
4. Psychological Warfare
5. Hacker Warfare
6. Ecconomic Warfare
7. Cyberwarfare
